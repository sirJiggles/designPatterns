# Strategy pattern

`defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.`

* Algorithms in our example here are the behaviors of that are inter changeable
* we do this rather than the typical inheritance method of extending a duck
* the classes and their variables are not 'concrete implementations' they can change the functionality even at run time!
