# Design patterns

This repo is just some small samples that I am making while working through the book "Head First Design Patterns"

Each folder is a pattern and in each to compile and test the output do the following

- cd into the folder e.g. strategy
- run `tsc` on the command line to compile the ts
- this will output the js into the dist folder
- cd into dist
- run `node run.js`

tldr `tsc && node dist/run.js`

The book is a great read and I would advise it to anyone this repo just scratches the surface of the goods within. It is more a ref for me and a place to physically type / play with patterns.
